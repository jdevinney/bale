The conveyor package offers the usual build process provided by the GNU
autotools, namely: configure; make; make check; make install.  But it also
supports autotuning of the default buffer size and communication mechanism.
So the recommended sequence of steps is:

   configure; make; make check; make tune; make; make install

Both 'make check' and 'make tune' require an argument that specifies how to
launch a parallel job.

Conveyors can make use of several different underlying communication
mechanisms, which involve different configuration options and dependencies.
The supported mechanisms are:

0) Trivial (no parallelism)
1) Raw SHMEM
2) Raw MPI
3) UPC
4) mpp_utilV4 with SHMEM
5) mpp_utilV4 with MPI
6) mpp_utilV4 with no parallelism


CONFIGURATION

When running the configure script, use the --prefix= option to specify the
top-level installation directory.  Otherwise you won't be able to build
anything else using conveyors; you will only be able to run the built-in
test/benchmark program.


BUILDING WITH SHMEM OR MPI

When given the option --with-shmem or --with-mpi, the configuration script
assumes that the underlying communication mechanism is SHMEM or MPI,
respectively.  It further assumes that the compiler and linker can
automatically find the SHMEM or MPI headers and libraries.  To achieve this
on a Cray system, for instance, it should suffice to ensure that a SHMEM
module is loaded and then configure with

   ./configure --with-shmem CC=cc --prefix=...

If necessary, you can force the configure script to use the SHMEM library
by writing something like

   ./configure --with-shmem --prefix=... CPPFLAGS="-I$SHMEM_ROOT/include" \
      LDFLAGS="-L$SHMEM_ROOT/lib" LIBS="-loshmem"

after setting the variable SHMEM_ROOT appropriately.


BUILDING WITH UPC

The configuration option --with-upc causes the conveyor package to use UPC
source code and communication mechanisms.  The configure script must be
given an appropriate compiler, because its default compiler is gcc.  Both
the variables CC and UPC must be set.  For instance, in the Cray
programming environment:

   ./configure --with-upc --prefix=... CC="cc -hupc" UPC="cc -hupc"

You may have to run the configure script on the back end (e.g., via srun)
if the front end cannot execute UPC programs.  Or if that fails, you can
use cross-compiling options to tell the configure script that it cannot
run compiled programs.  As an example,

   ./configure --with-upc --prefix=... CC="cc -hupc" UPC="cc -hupc" \
      --build=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --host=x86_64-cray-linux-gnu

It probably doesn't matter what the build and host values are, as long
as they have the correct format.

The conveyor package is not currently compatible with Berkeley UPC for a
variety of reasons, known and unknown.  Even if the build process can be
made to work, the asynchronous conveyors may deadlock.


BUILDING IN TRIVIAL MODE

For testing and debugging, it can be desirable to build a single-process
version of a parallel program with all communication mechanisms turned off
(as they may not even exist on the same platform as the desired debugging
tools).  So the conveyor package can be built in a "degenerate" or
"trivial" mode in which a conveyor is merely a local FIFO queue.  Omitting
all the --with options above (--with-shmem, --with-mpi, --with-upc,
--with-mpp) causes the conveyor library to work in this fashion.


CHECKING THE BUILD

It is a good idea to verify the build if possible, but this requires a
small amount of preparation.  First, the build directory must live on a
filesystem from which parallel programs can be launched.  Second, you must
tell 'make check' how to launch a parallel job with 96 processes (or any
positive multiple of 96), unless the conveyor package was built in a
non-parallel mode.  Set the LAUNCH variable either as an environment
variable or on the 'make check' command line, as in the following examples:

   make check LAUNCH="srun -n96"
   make check LAUNCH="mpirun -np 192"
   make check LAUNCH="salloc -n96 mpirun -np 96"

In general, the value of LAUNCH must be a valid command prefix, so that

   $LAUNCH <executable> <command-line arguments>

works.  In a non-parallel mode, use LAUNCH="".

In a pinch, you can directly run the scripts

   ./test_simple
   ./test_twohop
   ./test_tensor
   ./test_elastic

after setting the LAUNCH environment variable appropriately.  (This example
assumes that you built in the source directory.  Otherwise, stay in the
build directory and replace "." by the path to the source directory.)


AUTOTUNING

To optimize the conveyor installation, one should run a tuning job on a
substantial number of nodes.  On a large system, 128 nodes is recommended.
You need to tell 'make tune' how to launch a job of the appropriate size.
For instance, with 32 cores per node, you might say:

   make tune LAUNCH="srun -n4096"

After 'make tune' finishes, you need to run 'make' again to compile the
new configuration into the conveyor library.


INSTALLATION

Because the build no longer uses libtool, its final products live in the
build directory.  To put them in the designated place, type "make install".
